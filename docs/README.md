# Geotrellis Markdown Index

Getting started with any library is a frustrating — often intimidating —
experience. GeoTrellis is not an exception: perhaps you're not a Scala
developer (or a developer at all) or maybe you know your way around code
but are new to the specific domain of GIS software. Whatever the case,
the collected notes, use-cases, and examples in this folder are intended
to help you grapple with the various components which make up
GeoTrellis.
