geotrellis-spark-pipeline
-------------------------

Pipelines are the operative construct in GeoTrellis,
the original idea was taken from `PDAL <https://pdal.io/pipeline.html>`__.
Pipelines represent a set of instructions rather than a simple ETL process:
how to read data, transform (process), write it. The result of the Pipeline
should not always be writing, it can also be some intermediate transformation result,
or just a raw data.

*Provides:* ``geotrellis.spark.pipeline.*``

-  Provides a Scala DSL that abstracts over GeoTrellis pipeline operations. It also allows
   users to avoid manually writing the JSON DSL.

   reproject, pyramid) and writes (all supported GeoTrellis stores).
