/** An isomorphism for any GeoTrellis geometry type that can convert
  * between a collection of Command Integers. As of version 2.1 of
  * the VectorTile spec, there is no explicit difference between single
  * and multi geometries. When there eventually is, this trait will have to be
  * split to provide separate instances for both the single and multi forms.
  *
  * Since we assume that all VectorTiles implicitely exist in some CRS,
  * we ask for the top-left corner of the current Tile's extent, as well
  * as its resolution in order to perform the transformation into CRS space.
  *
  * Instances of this trait can be found in the package object.
  *
  * Usage:
  * {{{
  * val topLeft: Point = ...
  * val resolution: Double = ...
  *
  * implicitly[ProtobufGeom[Point, MultiPoint]].fromCommands(Command.commands(Seq(9,2,2)), topLeft, resolution)
  * }}}
