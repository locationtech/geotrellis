- The length of the key (the space-filling curve index or address) used for layer reading and writing has been extended from a fixed length of 8 bytes to an arbitrary length. This change affects not only the `geotrellis.spark` package, but all backends (excluding `geotrellis.geowave` and `geotrellis.geomesa`).
- Reprojection has improved performance due to one less shuffle stage and lower memory usage. `TileRDDReproject` loses dependency on `TileReprojectMethods` in favor of `RasterRegionReproject`
- The Ascii draw methods are now method extensions of `Tile`.
- Replace `geotrellis.util.Functor` with `cats.Functor`.
- Specifying the `maxTileSize` for a COGLayer that's to be written is now done via `COGLayerWriter.Options` which can be passed directly to the `write` methods.
- Specifying the `compression` for a COGLayer that's to be written is now done via `COGLayerWriter.Options` which can be passed directly to the `write` methods.
- The attribute name for `COGLayerStorageMetadata` is now `metadata` instead of `cog_metadata`.
- `Scalaz` streams were replaced by `fs2` streams.
- Refactored `HBaseInstance`, now accepts a plain Hadoop `Configuration` object.

- Use `pureconfig` to handle all work with configuration files.
- Change `TilerMethods.tileToLayout` functions that accept `TileLayerMetadata` as an argument to return `RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]` instead of `RDD[(K, V)]`.
- Expose `attributeStore` parameter to LayerReader interface.
- Added exponential backoffs in `S3RDDReader`.
- Changed `SinglebandGeoTiff` and `MultibandGeoTiff` crop function behavior to work properly with cases when extent to crop by doesn't intersect tiff extent.
- All classes and objects in the `geowave` package now use the spelling: `GeoWave` in their names.
- `TileLayerMetadata.fromRdd` method has been renamed to `TileLayerMetadata.fromRDD`.
- `KeyBounds.fromRdd` method has been renamed to `KeyBounds.fromRDD`.
- Removed implicit conversion from `Raster[T]` to `T` ([#2771](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2771)).
- Removed `decompress` option from `GeoTiffReader` functions.
- `geotrellis.spark-etl` package is deprecated since GeoTrellis 2.0.
- `Input.maxTileSize` is `256` by default to correspond `HadoopGeoTiffRDD` default behavior.
- `geotrellis.slick.Projected` has been moved to `geotrellis.vector.Projected`
- StreamingHistogram.binCount now returns non-zero counts ([#2590](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2590))
- HilbertSpatialKeyIndex index offset. Existing spatial layers using Hilbert index will need to be updated ([#2586](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2586))
- Fixed `CastException` that sometimes occurred when reading cached attributes.
- Uncompressed `GeoTiffMultibandTiles` will now convert to the correct `CellType`.
- Calculating the Slope of a `Tile` when `targetCell` is `Data` will now produce the correct result.
- Introduce new hooks into `AttributeStore` trait to allow for better performance in certain queries against catalogs with many layers.
- `GeoTiffReader` can now read tiffs that are missing the `NewSubfileType` tag.
- Pyramiding code will once again respect resampling method and will now actually reduce shuffle volume by resampling tiles on map side of pyramid operation.
- `COGLayer` attributes can be accessed via the various read attribute methods in `AttributeStore` (ie `readMetadata`, `readHeader`, etc)
- The regex used to match files for the `HadoopLayerAttributeStore` and `FileLayerAttributeStore` has been expanded to include more characters.
- `HadoopAttributeStore.availableAttributes` has been fixed so that it'll now list all attribute files.
- Allow for simple features to be generated with a specified or random id with geometry stored in the standard field, `the_geom`
- Update version of Amazon SDK API to remove deprecation warnings.
- Fixed a bug in incorrect metadata fetch by `COGLayerReader` that could lead to an incorrect data querying.
- Cropping RDDs with `clamp=false` now produces correct result.
- Fixed tiff reads in case `RowsPerStrip` tiff tag is not defined.
- Change aspect result to azimuth, i.e. start from due north and be clockwise.
- COG overviews generated in the `COGLayer.fromLayerRDD` method will now use the passed in `ResampleMethod`.

- `GeoTiffMultibandTile.crop` will now return `ArrayMultibandTile`(s) with the correct number of bands.
- Improved performance of `COGValueReader.readSubsetBands` when reading from S3.

### Removed

- `LayerUpdater` with its functionality covered by `LayerWriter` ([#2663](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2663)).

## [1.2.0] - 2017-11-06

This release cycle saw a regular contributor [Simeon Fitch](https://github.com/metasim) elevated to official *Committer* status within GeoTrellis.

The team would like to thank him, along with our newest contributors [Aaron Santos](https://github.com/aaron-santos), [Austin Heyne](https://github.com/aheyne), [Christos Charmatzis](https://github.com/Charmatzis), [Jessica Austin](https://github.com/jessicaaustin), and [@mteldridge](https://github.com/mteldridge) for helping make this release possible.

### Changed

- `geotrellis.raster`
  - **Deprecation:** `GridBounds.size` in favor of `GridBounds.sizeLong`.
  - **Deprecation:** `GridBounds.coords` in favor of `GridBounds.coordsIter`.
  - **New:** `GridBounds.offset` and `GridBounds.buffer` for creating a modified `GridBounds` from an existing one.
  - **New:** `ColorRamps.greyscale: Int => ColorRamp`, which will generate a ramp when given some number of stops.
  - **New:** `ConstantTile.fromBytes` to create any type of `ConstantTile` from an `Array[Byte]`.
  - **New:** `Tile.rotate90: Int => Tile`, `Tile.flipVertical: Tile` and `Tile.flipHorizontal: Tile`.
- `geotrellis.vector`
  - **New:** `Geometry.isEmpty: Boolean`. This incurs much less overhead than previous ways of determining emptiness.
  - **New:** `Line.head` and `Line.last` for **efficiently** grabbing the first or last `Point` in the `Line`.
- `geotrellis.spark`
  - **Deprecation:** The `LayerUpdater` trait hierarchy. Use `LayerWriter.update` or `LayerWriter.overwrite` instead.

  - **New:** `ValueReader.attributeStore: AttributeStore`
  - **New:** `TileLayerRDD.toSpatialReduce: ((V, V) => V) => TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey]` for smarter folding of 3D tile layers into 2D tile layers.
  - The often-used `apply` method overloads in `MapKeyTransform` have been given more descriptive aliases.
  - **Change:** Querying a layer will now produce a result whose metadata will have an `Extent` and `KeyBounds` of the queried region and not of the whole layer.
- `geotrellis.vectortile` (experimental)
  - **New:** `VectorTile.toGeoJson` and `VectorTile.toIterable`.
  - Library simplified by assuming the codec backend will always be protobuf.

### Added

#### Rasterizing `Geometry` Layers

Finally, the full marriage of the `vector`, `raster`, and `spark`
packages! You can now transform an `RDD[Geometry]` into a writable
GeoTrellis layer of `(SpatialKey, Tile)`!

```scala
val geoms: RDD[Geometry] = ...
val celltype: CellType = ...
val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...
val value: Double = ...  /* Value to fill the intersecting pixels with */

val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] with Metadata[LayoutDefinition] =
  geoms.rasterize(value, celltype, layout)
```

#### Clipping `Geometry` Layers to a Grid

In a similar vein to the above, you can now transform an arbitrarily
large collection of Geometries into a proper GeoTrellis layer, where the
sections of each Geometry are clipped to fit inside their enclosing
Extents.

![Clipping Geometry to Grid](img/cliptogrid.png)

Here we can see a large `Line` being clipped into nine sublines. It's
one method call:

```scala
import geotrellis.spark._

val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...  /* The definition of your grid */
val geoms: RDD[Geometry] = ...      /* Result of some previous work */

/* There are likely many clipped Geometries per SpatialKey... */
val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Geometry)] = geoms.clipToGrid(layout)

/* ... so we can group them! */
val grouped: RDD[(SpatialKey, Iterable[Geometry])] = layer.groupByKey
```

If clipping on the Extent boundaries is not what you want, there are ways to customize this. See [the ClipToGrid entry in our Scaladocs](https://geotrellis.github.io/scaladocs/latest/#geotrellis.spark.clip.ClipToGrid$).

#### Sparkified Viewshed

A [Viewshed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewshed) shows "visibility" from some set vantage point, given an Elevation raster. Prior to GeoTrellis 1.2 this was possible at the individual `Tile` level but not the Layer (`RDD`) level. Now it is.

First, we need to think about the `Viewpoint` type:

```scala
import geotrellis.spark.viewshed._

val point: Viewpoint(
  x = ...,                    // some coordinate.
  y = ...,                    // some coordinate.
  viewHeight = 4000,          // 4 kilometres above the surface.
  angle = Math.PI / 2,        // direction that the "camera" faces (in radians). 0 == east.
  fieldOfView = Math.PI / 2,  // angular width of the "view port".
  altitude = 0                // the height of points you're interested in seeing.
)
```

In other words:

- x, y, viewHeight: where are we?
  - angle: what direction are we looking?
  - fieldOfView: how wide are we looking?
  - altitude: how high/low is the "target" of our viewing?

Given a `Seq[Viewpoint]` (the algorithm supports multiple simultaneous
view points), we can do:

```scala
// Recall this common alias:
//   type TileLayerRDD[K] = RDD[(K, Tile)] with Metadata[TileLayerMetadata[K]]

val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...  /* Result of previous work */

val viewshed: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = layer.viewshed(Seq(point))
```

#### Sparkified Euclidean Distance

We use *Euclidean Distance* to render a collection of points into a
heat-map of proximities of some area. Say, of two roads crossing:

![Euclidean Distance Diagram](img/euclid.png)

Prior to GeoTrellis 1.2, this was possible at the individual `Tile`
level but not the Layer (`RDD`) level. Now it is.

```scala
/* Result of previous work. Potentially millions of points per SpatialKey. */
val points: RDD[(SpatialKey, Array[Coordinate])] = ...
val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...  /* The definition of your grid */

val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] = points.euclideanDistance(layout)
```

#### Polygonal Summaries over Time

The following was possible prior to GeoTrellis 1.2:

```scala
val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...
val polygon: Polgyon = ...

/* The maximum value within some Polygon overlaid on a Tile layer */
val summary: Double = layer.polygonalMaxDouble(polygon)
```

The above is also now possible for layers keyed by `SpaceTimeKey` to
form a "time series":

```scala
val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpaceTimeKey] = ...
val polygon: MultiPolygon = ...

/* The maximum value within some Polygonal area at each time slice */
val summary: Map[ZonedDateTime, Double] = layer.maxSeries(polygon)
```

#### `OverzoomingValueReader`

A GeoTrellis `ValueReader` connects to some layer catalog and lets you
read individual values (usually Tiles):

```scala
import geotrellis.spark.io.s3._

val store: AttributeStore = ...
val reader: Reader[SpatialKey, Tile] = S3ValueReader(store).reader(LayerId("my-catalog", 10))

val tile: Tile = reader.read(SpatialKey(10, 10))
```

However `.reader` is limited to zoom levels that actually exist for the
given layer. Now you can use `.overzoomingReader` to go as deep as you
like:

```scala
import geotrellis.raster.resample._

val reader: Reader[SpatialKey, Tile] =
  S3ValueReader(store).overzoomingReader(LayerId("my-catalog", 20), Average)

val tile: Tile = reader.read(SpatialKey(1000, 1000))
```

#### Regridding a Tile Layer

Have you ever wanted to "redraw" a grid over an established GeoTrellis
layer? Say, this 16-tile Layer into a 4-tile one, both of 1024x1024
total pixels:

![Regrid Diagram](img/regrid.png)

Prior to GeoTrellis 1.2, there was no official way to do this. Now you
can use `.regrid`:

```scala
/* The result of some previous work. Say each Tile is 256x256. */
val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...

/* "Recut" the tiles so that each one is now 512x512.
 * No pixels are gained or lost, save some NODATA on the bottom
 * and right edges that may appear for padding purposes.
 */
val regridded: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = layer.regrid(512)
```

You can also regrid to non-rectangular sizes:

```scala
val regridded: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = layer.regrid(tileCols = 100, tileRows = 300)
```

#### Robust Layer Querying

It's common to find a subset of Tiles in a layer that are touched by
some given `Polygon`:

```scala
val poly: Polygon = ???

val rdd: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] =
 layerReader
    .query[SpatialKey, Tile, TileLayerMetadata[SpatialKey]](Layer("name", zoom))
    .where(Intersects(poly))
    .result
```

Now you can perform this same operation with `Line`, `MultiLine`, and
even `(Polygon, CRS)` to ensure that your Layer and Geometry always
exist in the same projection.

#### Improved `Tile` ASCII Art

Sometimes you just want to visualize a `Tile` without going through the
song-and-dance of rendering it to a `.png`. The existing
`Tile.asciiDraw` method *kind of* does that, except its output is all in
numbers.

The new `Tile.renderAscii: Palette => String` method fulfills your heart's desire:

```scala
import geotrellis.raster._
import geotrellis.raster.io.geotiff._
import geotrellis.raster.render.ascii._

val tile: Tile = SinglebandGeoTiff("path/to/tiff.tiff").tile

// println(tile.renderAscii())  // the default
println(tile.renderAscii(AsciiArtEncoder.Palette.STIPLED))
```

Gorgeous.

#### Storage on Azure via HDFS

By adding some additional configuration, you can now use our [HDFS Layer Backend](guide/tile-backends.html#hdfs) to read and write GeoTrellis layers to Microsoft Azure's blob storage.

#### S3 Configurability

[It's now possible to customize how our S3 backend communicates with S3.](guide/examples.html#work-with-s3-using-a-custom-s3client-configuration)

#### Configuring JTS Precision

GeoTrellis uses the [Java Topology Suite](https://github.com/locationtech/jts) for its vector processing. By default, JTS uses a "floating" [PrecisionModel](https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/PrecisionModel.html). When writing code that needs to be numerically robust, this default can lead to Topology Exceptions.

You can now use [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config)
to configure this to your application's needs. [See here for the
specifics.](guide/vectors.html#numerical-precision-and-topology-exceptions)

- [Fixed issue with BigTiff vs non-BigTiff offset value packing](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2247)

While we are trying to stick strictly to [SemVer](http://semver.org/), there are slight API changes in this release. We felt that while this does break SemVer in the strictest sense, the change were not enough to warrant a 2.0 release. Our hope is in the future to be more cognizant of API changes for future releases.

- Made EPSG capitalization [consistent in method names](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/commit/343588b4b066851ea6b35a7d9cc671f4a6d47f2c):
  - In `geotrellis.proj4.CRS`, changed `getEPSGCode` to `getEpsgCode`
  - In `geotrellis.proj4.io.wkt.WKT`, changed `fromEPSGCode` to `fromEpsgCode` and `getEPSGCode` to `getEpsgCode`

- Changed some internal but publicly visible [classes dealing with GeoTiff reading](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1905)
  - Changed `size` to `length` in `ArraySegmentBytes`
  - Replaced `foreach` on SegmentBytes with `getSegments`, which the caller can iterate over themselves
  - Changed `getDecompressedBytes` to `decompressGeoTiffSegment`

- Changed some internal but publicly visible [implicit classes and read methods around TiffTagReader](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2247)
  - Added as an implicit parameter to multiple locations, most publicly in `TiffTagReader.read(byteReader: ByteReader, tagsStartPosition: Long)(implicit ttos: TiffTagOffsetSize)`. Also changed that method from being generic to always taking a `Long` offset.

- Moved some misplaced [implicit `JsonFormats`](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1919)
  - Moved `CellTypeFormat` and `CellSizeFormat` from `geotrellis.spark.etl.config.json` in the `spark-etl` subproject to `geotrellis.raster.io.json.Implicits` in the `raster` subproject.

- Changed LazyLogger [from the `com.typesafe.scalalogging` version to our own version](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2017)
  - This shouldn't break any code, but technically is an API change.

## [0.10.0]

The long awaited GeoTrellis 0.10 release is here!

It’s been a while since the 0.9 release of GeoTrellis, and there are
many significant changes and improvements in this release. GeoTrellis
has become an expansive suite of modular components that aide users in
the building of geospatial application in Scala, and as always we’ve
focused specifically on high performance and distributed computing. This
is the first official release that supports working with Apache Spark,
and we are very pleased with the results that have come out of the
decision to support Spark as our main distributed processing engine.
Those of you who have been tuned in for a while know we started with a
custom built processing engine based on Akka actors; this original
execution engine still exists in 0.10 but is in a deprecated state in
the geotrellis-engine subproject. Along with upgrading GeoTrellis to
support Spark and handle arbitrarily-sized raster data sets, we’ve been
making improvements and additions to core functionality, including
adding vector and projection support.

It’s been long enough that release notes, stating what has changed since
0.9, would be quite unwieldy. Instead I put together a list of features
that GeoTrellis 0.10 supports. This is included in the README on the
GeoTrellis Github, but I will put them here as well. It is organized by
subproject, with more basic and core subprojects higher in the list, and
the subprojects that rely on that core functionality later in the list,
along with a high level description of each subproject.

### geotrellis-proj4

- Represent a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) based on Ellipsoid,
  Datum, and Projection.
- Translate CRSs to and from proj4 string representations.
- Lookup CRS's based on EPSG and other codes.
- Transform `(x, y)` coordinates from one CRS to another.

### geotrellis-vector

- Provides a scala idiomatic wrapper around JTS types: Point, Line
  (LineString in JTS), Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLine (MultiLineString
  in JTS), MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
- Methods for geometric operations supported in JTS, with results that
  provide a type-safe way to match over possible results of
  geometries.
- Provides a Feature type that is the composition of a geometry and a
  generic data type.
- Read and write geometries and features to and from GeoJSON.
- Read and write geometries to and from WKT and WKB.

  equality in geometries with an optional threshold.

### geotrellis-raster

- Provides types to represent single- and multi-band rasters,
  supporting Bit, Byte, UByte, Short, UShort, Int, Float, and Double
  data, with either a constant NoData value (which improves
  performance) or a user defined NoData value.
- Treat a tile as a collection of values, by calling "map" and
  "foreach", along with floating point valued versions of those
  methods (separated out for performance).
- Combine raster data in generic ways.
- Render rasters via color ramps and color maps to PNG and JPG images.
- Read GeoTiffs with DEFLATE, LZW, and PackBits compression, including
  horizontal and floating point prediction for LZW and DEFLATE.
- Write GeoTiffs with DEFLATE or no compression.
- Reproject rasters from one CRS to another.
- Resample of raster data.
- Mask and Crop rasters.
- Split rasters into smaller tiles, and stitch tiles into larger
  rasters.
- Derive histograms from rasters in order to represent the
  distribution of values and create quantile breaks.
- Local Map Algebra operations: Abs, Acos, Add, And, Asin, Atan,
  Atan2, Ceil, Cos, Cosh, Defined, Divide, Equal, Floor, Greater,
  GreaterOrEqual, InverseMask, Less, LessOrEqual, Log, Majority, Mask,
  Max, MaxN, Mean, Min, MinN, Minority, Multiply, Negate, Not, Or,

  Mean, Max, Sum.
- Cost distance operation based on a set of starting points and a
  friction raster.
- Hydrology operations: Accumulation, Fill, and FlowDirection.
- Rasterization of geometries and the ability to iterate over cell
  values covered by geometries.
- Vectorization of raster data.
- Kriging Interpolation of point data into rasters.
- Viewshed operation.

  represents a coordinate in space based on some uniform grid layout,
  optionally with a temporal component.
- Represent spatial or spatiotemporal raster data as an RDD of raster
  tiles.
- Generic architecture for saving/loading layers RDD data and metadata
  to/from various backends, using Spark's IO API with Space Filling
  Curve indexing to optimize storage retrieval (support for Hilbert
  curve and Z order curve SFCs). HDFS and local file system are
  supported backends by default, S3 and Accumulo are supported
  backends by the `geotrellis-s3` and `geotrellis-accumulo` projects,
  respectively.
- Query architecture that allows for simple querying of layer data by
  spatial or spatiotemporal bounds.
- Perform map algebra operations on layers of raster data, including
  all supported Map Algebra operations mentioned in the
  geotrellis-raster feature list.
- Perform seamless reprojection on raster layers, using neighboring
  tile information in the reprojection to avoid unwanted NoData cells.
- Pyramid up layers through zoom levels using various resampling
  methods.
- Types to reason about tiled raster layouts in various CRS's and
  schemes.
- Perform operations on raster RDD layers: crop, filter, join, mask,
  merge, partition, pyramid, render, resample, split, stitch, and
  tile.
- Polygonal summary over raster layers: Min, Mean, Max, Sum.
- Save spatially keyed RDDs of byte arrays to z/x/y files into HDFS or
  the local file system. Useful for saving PNGs off for use as map
  layers in web maps or for accessing GeoTiffs through z/x/y tile
  coordinates.
- Utilities around creating spark contexts for applications using
  GeoTrellis, including a Kryo registrator that registers most types.

### geotrellis-spark-testkit

- Utility code to create test RDDs of raster data.
- Matching methods to test equality of RDDs of raster data in
  scalatest unit tests.

### geotrellis-accumulo

- Save and load layers to and from Accumulo. Query large layers
  efficiently using the layer query API.

### geotrellis-cassandra

Save and load layers to and from Casandra. Query large layers
efficiently using the layer query API.

### geotrellis-s3

- Save/load raster layers to/from the local filesystem or HDFS using
  Spark's IO API.
- Save spatially keyed RDDs of byte arrays to z/x/y files in S3.
  Useful for saving PNGs off for use as map layers in web maps.

### geotrellis-etl

- Parse command line options for input and output of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) applications
- Utility methods that make ETL applications easier for the user to
  build.
- Work with input rasters from the local file system, HDFS, or S3
- Reproject input rasters using a per-tile reproject or a seamless
  reprojection that takes into account neighboring tiles.
- Transform input rasters into layers based on a ZXY layout scheme
- Save layers into Accumulo, S3, HDFS or the local file system.

### geotrellis-shapefile

- Read geometry and feature data from shapefiles into GeoTrellis types using GeoTools.

### geotrellis-slick

- Save and load geometry and feature data to and from PostGIS using
  the slick scala database library.
- Perform PostGIS `ST_` operations in PostGIS through scala.
