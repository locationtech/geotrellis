#geotrellis.raster.mapalgebra

As mentioned at the [root of `geotrellis.raster`](..), the contents of `mapalgebra` are organized by type of operation. This is a brief introduction to those submodules through the lens of those operation types. Some of these types can be understood as separating concerns about how location-aware their operations need to be; keep an eye out for that.

- [`geotrellis.raster.local`](./local) defines operations which act on a cell without regard to its spatial relations. Need to double every cell on a tile? This is the module you'll want to explore.
- [`geotrellis.raster.focal`](./focal) defines operations operations which focus on two-dimensional windows of a raster's values to determine their outputs. [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) can be seen as a focal operation in that each cell's value depends on neighboring cell values. Though focal operations will tend to look at a local region of this or that cell, they should not be confused with the operations which live in `geotrellis.raster.local` - those operations encode transformations over tiles which, for any step of the calculation, need only know the input value of the specific cell for which it is calculating an output.
- [`geotrellis.raster.zonal`](./zonal) defines operations which apply over a zones as defined by corresponding cell values in the zones raster.
- [`geotrellis.raster.global`](./global) defines operations which are completely aware of all a tile's cell values.
