/**
  * Since lanczos resample inherits from cubic resample it
  * is only needed to test the actual math, the rest is tested in the cubic
  * resample spec and the bilinear resample spec.
  *
  * It is also known that the bicubic resample resolves, if the cube
  * is D * D points, first D rows then the D values of each resample
  * result, and resample them.
  *
  * The lanczos resample is not divided into unidimensional resamples
  * when doing bidiminensional resamples. Therefore the testing revolves
  * around testing different matrices.
  *
  * The LanczosResample class uses a helper class, which is the only class
  * being tested here.
  *
  * I haven't been able to find a single good source for lanczos
  * resample in two dimensions.
  *
  * These values are calculated by hand by Johan Stenberg, and should match the
  * GeoTrellis lanczos lnterpolation implementation.
